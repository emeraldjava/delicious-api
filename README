Client API for Delicious (http://delicious.com) social bookmarking service for Java applications. This library was first created on 2006, is totally self-contained (no additional JARs are required to use it) and very simple to use. Yeah, I know what you are going to ask:
- "2006?! Why are you releasing it just now?" > Because I just stumbled on the source code today :)
- "Have you considered using library X or Y for this purpose?" > No, I started delicious-api as toy project during a very boring FIFA World Cup 2006 match (Brazil vs. Gana) just for fun.
- "Ouch, you are manually parsing the results from Delicious!? Why..." > Because I just didn't want to use any third party library. I know I could use, e.g. JDom, I know it is very simple and self-contained, bla bla bla, but I simply didn't want to.
- "And what if..." > Don't ask me. Fork this project and improve it. It is free :)
